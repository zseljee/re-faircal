# Data

This directory contains the data for the BFW and RFW sets.  It also contains the license for both datasets, which should be abided by.  Only research may be done with both datasets, BFW allows education too.

To set up this directory correctly with the code, extract the BFW dataset into a folder called `TBD` and extract RFW into `TBD`.

The Table below was copied from the repository [README](../README.md)
